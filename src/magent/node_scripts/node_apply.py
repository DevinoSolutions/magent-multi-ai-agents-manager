"""magent node apply: lays this PC's Claude Code user scope onto a node.

Runs ON the node as the node user, under the node's own python3 (3.8+,
stdlib only -- nothing from magent is installed there). It travels inside the
provisioning payload (remote_mux.build_payload); provision.sh extracts that
into a private temp dir, then runs ``main`` from there with the gh token on
stdin. Every step prints status<TAB>item<TAB>detail rows
(remote_mux.parse_report) and is skipped when its content digest matches the
last run that finished it cleanly -- the store is ~/.magent/provision.json.
A step that warned or failed is not recorded, so the next provision looks
again. A deliberate drop (a hook whose program this node lacks) is a clean
result: the same payload on the same node drops it again, and ``--force``
(what ``magent node setup`` sends) re-looks after a tool is installed.

provision.sh calls ``main`` through ``python3 -c``: a src module may not
raise SystemExit (lint MD001), so ``main`` returns the exit code.
