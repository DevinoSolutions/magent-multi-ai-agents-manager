"""The single owner of every subprocess aimed at a node (spec §6).

ssh argv, ``tmux -L magent`` on the node, the shipped ``node_scripts``, and the
local git reads a bring-up needs. Every function returns data or raises
``RemoteError``; nothing here prints or exits. Four laws:

- a remote command is a list, sent as ``bash -c <shlex.quote(shlex.join(argv))>``
  -- never an f-string shell, and never parsed by the node user's LOGIN shell
  (zsh expands a bare ``=word``, which is every exact tmux target ``=<sid>``);
- every call is bounded: ``timeout_s`` is a required keyword, so a call that
  forgot it is a TypeError, never a hang;
- secrets travel on stdin only -- never argv, never a log line;
  ``RemoteError.command_redacted`` names stdin by its length alone;
- ``BatchMode=yes`` everywhere: a password prompt nobody can answer is a hang.

A leaf: never imports ``magent.cli`` (LS-A-001); its magent imports are the
leaves ``attach_client``, ``log``, ``node_scripts`` and ``nodes``.
